# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

Clone the repository to any directory on your computer.

## Local Development

```
cd DocusaurusDocumentation
npx docusaurus start
```
This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window directed to http://localhost:3000/. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```
This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
